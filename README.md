# Slurm Tutorial at NJIT

## Project Description
The repo introduces you to how to use Slurm for data science at NJIT cluster Lochness. NJIT has already published a [wiki](https://wiki.hpc.arcs.njit.edu/index.php/HPC_and_BD). However, it was not well documented. This repo includes more detailed examples for data science, especially for creating your Python scientific environments, GPU training, using Jupyter Lab, etc. **Feel free to star this project if you find it helpful!**
